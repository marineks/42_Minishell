/*
**	THE POINT OF A LEXER_
**	Roughly speaking, the shell reads its input and divides the input into
**	words and operators, employing the quoting rules to select which meanings
**	to assign various words and characters.
**
**	The shell then parses these tokens into commands and other constructs,
**	removes the special meaning of certain words or characters, expands others,
**	redirects input and output as needed, executes the specified command,
**	waits for the commandâ€™s exit status, and makes that exit status available
**	for further inspection or processing.
*/

/**
 *	@brief Tokenize splits the command line issued by the user.
 *	@param data - our main structure that will host the chained list of the
 *				   the tokens in data->token.
 *	@param line - the string that will be split
 *
 *	This is the first part of the lexer, where we divide the line into two
 *	big types of tokens : WORDS and SEPARATORS (for instance pipes, redir.,
 *	heredocs and blanks).
 *	This function :
 *	- checks each character of line to find whether there is a separator
 *	- in order to do so, we first make sure that the separator is not inhibited
 *	  by quotes (states : SIMPLE or DOUBLE)
